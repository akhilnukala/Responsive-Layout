# Responsive Layout

Built a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS, which responds to small, medium, and large viewport sizes and devices.

Wrote basic layout styles to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using media queries, add breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.
